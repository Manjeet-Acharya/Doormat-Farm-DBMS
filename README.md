# Doormat-Farm-DBMS
This project contains the EER diagram and SQL codes for a database creation and management for a meal-kit delivery startup. 

To inderstand the Database, first start with the Details_business.pdf file. It contains the details about the start-up meal-kit delivery, the entities related to the business, and the fundamentals of the data that will be collected. 

After that, look at the EER Diagram, Mapping Relations, and the Normalization in that order. The database creation was done in that order and that is the right order. 

Finally connect to your database management software and run the .sql files:
projectDBcreate.sql -- this will create all the tables needed for the business.
projectDBinsert.sql -- this will insert dummy data for all of the tables created before.
projectDBupdate.sql -- use this if you need to update any of the tables. modify code as needed.
projectDBqueries -- this file is for analysis. It provides insights into which meal-kit is popular among your customers, which drivers are more effecient, and which zip codes are optimal for new warehouses
projectDBdrop -- this file drops all the tables and purges the data altogether.
